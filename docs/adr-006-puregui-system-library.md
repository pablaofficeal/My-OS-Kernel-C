# ADR-006: PureGUI modular system library

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Ring-3 applications currently call framebuffer syscalls directly. Repeating
window chrome, client-coordinate translation, input polling and widget drawing
in every application makes the UI inconsistent and couples applications to the
current framebuffer ABI. Porting Qt would add a runtime, allocator and platform
surface far larger than the operating system currently needs.

The first release must remain freestanding, avoid dynamic allocation, run on
the existing syscall ABI and be usable from small C programs.

## Decision

Introduce PureGUI as two static system libraries:

- `/lib/libpuregui.a` provides themes, foreground windows, clipped drawing and
  normalized keyboard/mouse events.
- `/lib/libpguiw.a` provides labels, panels and buttons on top of the
  core library.

Public headers live under `/include`. Applications use client-relative
coordinates and link only the layers they need. The ABI begins at
`PG_API_VERSION 1`.

PureGUI version 1 deliberately supports one foreground window owned by the
running application. Rendering still uses the existing framebuffer syscalls;
the public API does not expose that backend so a future compositor can replace
it without changing application source.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Applications no longer implement window frames and input normalization.
- Core and widgets are separately linkable and contain no heap dependency.
- A future window server can preserve the application-facing API.

### Negative

- Windows cannot overlap safely and are not independently composited.
- Static linking duplicates the small client runtime in each application.
- Text uses the current fixed-width system font.

### Neutral

- `/bin/gui-demo` acts as executable API documentation.
- PureGUI and its applications are compiled with `-mgeneral-regs-only` until
  the kernel provides per-process SIMD/FPU context management.

## Alternatives Considered

**Port Qt** was rejected because its platform abstraction, event loop and
runtime dependencies are disproportionate to the current kernel.

**Put widgets in the kernel** was rejected because widget policy does not need
kernel privilege and would make the syscall ABI difficult to evolve.

**Build a compositor first** was deferred until processes can share surfaces
and receive routed input events.
